History

        This is an update of Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and
        unix2dos.  Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos are
        part of several Linux distributions such as RedHat, Fedora, Suse and
        others.  This update includes all RedHat patches and fixes several
        other problems.  Internationalization has been added and ports to DOS,
        Windows, Cygwin and OS/2 Warp have been made. 

	These implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos were originally made as
	an Open Source alternative for dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris.
	They have a few similar conversion modes, namely ascii, 7bit and iso.
	The first versions were made by John Birchfield in 1989, and in 1995
	rewritten from scratch by Benjamin Lin. Mac to Unix conversion was
	added by Bernd Johannes Wuebben in 1998, Unix to Mac conversion by
	Erwin Waterlander in 2010.
