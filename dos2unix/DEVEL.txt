Information about dos2unix' implementation choices.

1. Smart conversion
===================

There are some dos2unix implementations that automatically convert all type of
line breaks. For instance converting both DOS and Mac linebreaks to Unix line
breaks at once. Or automatically detect the line break type and convert to the
other side.

I'm not in favour of this, because this could lead to unexpected behaviour. I
think that a tool must do what you tell it to do. When you run 'dos2unix' only
DOS line breaks must be converted to Unix line breaks. Seen from a DOS or Unix
perspective, a Mac line break is not a line break, so it must stay untouched.


2. Unix filter
==============

When a standard Unix filter, e.g. sed or tr, reads input from a file it sends
its output by default to standard out. This implementation of dos2unix does by
default in-place conversion (overwriting the input file), which seems not in line.

First of all, dos2unix is not part of the Unix standard. Most Unixes have their
own implementation of dos2unix. There is a lot of variation in command names
and options. This implementation of dos2unix does send the output to standard
out when the input comes from standard in. So you can use it as filter. Second,
this implementation of dos2unix has enough legacy on its own to keep the
current behaviour.  Most people expect dos2unix to do in-place conversion.
Note that dos2unix/unix2dos is also used a lot on non-Unix operating systems where
the filter idea is less known.


3. Recursive conversion of files
================================

There are implementations that have builtin functionality to do recursive
conversion of all files in a directory tree.

This functionality is not needed in dos2unix. By using an external program,
like Unix 'find', you can do recursive conversion of directory trees.  The find
program is much more powerful than internal recursive searching ever can be.


4. Encoding conversion
======================

Dos2unix can do several encoding conversions. First there are the conversions
of several DOS code pages to and from ISO-8859-1. These conversions are also
part of the SunOS dos2unix implementation after which this implementation has
been modeled. Although these conversions are not much used these days they have
been added for the sake completeness. Conversion of CP1252 was added, because
it is used a lot in the Western world and almost identical to ISO-8859-1. There
is no intention to add other conversions to and from ISO-8859-1.

Conversion from UTF-16 was added, because the world is moving to Unicode.
Microsoft Windows uses by default UTF-16 format for Unicode. UTF-16 is part of
Windows' core design for historical reasons. Microsoft standardized on UCS-2, a
predecessor of UTF-16, in a time when UTF-8 did not exist yet. However a lot of
Windows software is able to read UTF-8 files. In Windows "Unicode" means
usually UTF-16. For instance saving a file with Notepad in "Unicode" encoding
means in UTF-16 encoding. When you work in PowerShell and echo some text to a
file you get an UTF-16 encoded text file. UTF-16 is there to stay, although
many people would like to see otherwise and are dreaming of an UTF-8 only
world. The Unix/Linux world is moving to UTF-8 encoding, because it's backwards
compatible with ASCII. Unix programs typically do not support UTF-16.

One end of the spectrum is an ASCII only world, where the only differences
between DOS and Unix files are line breaks. In English speaking regions this is
a good working environment, because ASCII is practically enough for the English
language. Diacritics are hardly used. The other end of the spectrum is an
Unicode only world. All languages of the world are supported. Dos2unix aims to
support these two ends of the spectrum: ASCII and Unicode. Other encoding
transformations are left to specialized programs like iconv and recode. The few
conversion modes to and from ISO=8859-1 are only there for legacy reasons.

In the ASCII days DOS to Unix text file conversion, and vice versa, was only
converting line breaks.  In the Unicode era it is not only line break
conversion, but also Unicode transformation format conversion (e.g. UTF-16 to
UTF-8), and Byte Order Mark (BOM) removal or addition.

Conversion towards UTF-16 is not supported and there is no intention to support
it in the future. UTF-8 encoded files are well supported on Windows, so
conversion to UTF-16 is not needed. And we keep on dreaming of an UTF-8 only
world...
