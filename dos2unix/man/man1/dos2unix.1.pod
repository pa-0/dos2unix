=head1 NAME

dos2unix - DOS/MAC to UNIX and vice versa text file format converter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dos2unix [options] [-c CONVMODE] [-o FILE ...] [-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
    unix2dos [options] [-c CONVMODE] [-o FILE ...] [-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Dos2unix package includes utilities C<dos2unix> and C<unix2dos> to convert
plain text files in DOS or MAC format to UNIX format and vice versa.  Binary files
and non-regular files, such as soft links, are automatically skipped, unless
conversion is forced.

Dos2unix has a few conversion modes similar to dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris.

In DOS/Windows text files line endings exist out of a combination of two characters:
a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF).
In Unix text files line endings exists out of a single Newline character which
is equal to a DOS Line Feed (LF) character.
In Mac text files, prior to Mac OS X, line endings exist out of a single Carriage
Return character. Mac OS X is Unix based and has the same line endings as Unix.

=head1 OPTIONS

Set conversion mode. Where CONVMODE is one of:
I<ascii>, I<7bit>, I<iso>, I<mac>
with ascii being the default.

must be given in pairs and wildcard names should NOT be used or you WILL
lose your files.

=head1 CONVERSION MODES

Conversion modes I<ascii>, I<7bit>, and I<iso>
are similar to those of dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris.

=over 4

=item B<ascii>

B<dos2unix>: In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings.
Unix and Mac line endings are not changed.

B<unix2dos>: In this mode Unix line endings are converted to DOS line endings.
DOS and Mac line endings are not changed.

Although the name of this mode is ASCII, which is a 7 bit standard,
the actual mode is 8 bit.

=item B<mac>

B<dos2unix>: In this mode Mac line endings are converted to Unix line endings.
DOS and Unix line endigs are not changed. You can also use the command C<mac2unix> to
run dos2unix in Mac mode.

B<unix2dos>: In this mode Unix line endings are converted to Mac line endings.
DOS and Mac line endigs are not changed. You can also use the command C<unix2mac> to
run unix2dos in Mac mode.

=item B<7bit>

In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings or vice versa.
All 8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to 255) are converted
to a space.

=item B<iso>

In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings or vice versa.
Characters are converted between the DOS character set (code page) CP437 and ISO
character set ISO-8859-1 on Unix. CP437 characters without ISO-8859-1
equivalent, for which conversion is not possible, are converted to a dot. The
same counts for ISO-8859-1 characters without CP437 counterpart. CP437 is
mainly used in the USA. In Western Europe CP850 is more standard.

Another option to convert text files between different encodings is to use
dos2unix in combination with iconv(1). Iconv can convert between a long list of
character encodings. Some examples:

Convert from DOS DOSLatinUS to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP437 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from DOS DOSLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP850 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP1252 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows UTF-16 (Unicode) to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS DOSLatinUS

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP437 > out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS DOSLatin1

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP850 > out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to Windows WinLatin1

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP1252 > out.txt

Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows WinLatin1

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t CP1252 in.txt > out.txt

Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows UTF-16 (Unicode)

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 > out.txt

=head1 UNICODE

Unicode files can be encoded in different encodings. On Unix/Linux Unicode
files are mostly encoded in UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is ASCII compatible. UTF-8
files can be in DOS, Unix or Mac format. It is safe to run dos2unix/unix2dos on
UTF-8 encoded files. On Windows mostly UTF-16 encoding is used for Unicode
files. Dos2unix/unix2dos should not be run on UTF-16 files. UTF-16 files are
automatically skipped, because it are binary files.

=head1 LOCALIZATION

=over 4

=item B<LANG>

The primary language is selected with the environment variable LANG. The LANG
variable consists out of several parts.  The first part is in small letters the
language code. The second is optional and is the country code in capital
letters, preceded with an underscore. There is also an optional third part:
character encoding, preceded with a dot. A few examples for POSIX standard type
shells:

    export LANG=nl               Dutch
    export LANG=nl_NL            Dutch, The Netherlands
    export LANG=nl_BE            Dutch, Belgium
    export LANG=es_ES            Spanish, Spain
    export LANG=es_MX            Spanish, Mexico
    export LANG=en_US.iso88591   English, USA, Latin-1 encoding
    export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8      English, UK, UTF-8 encoding

For a complete list of language and country codes see the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes>

On Unix systems you can use to command locale(1) to get locale specific
information.

=item B<LANGUAGE>

With the LANGUAGE environment variable you can specify a priority list of
languages, separated by colons. Wcd gives preference to LANGUAGE over LANG.
For instance, first Dutch and then German: C<LANGUAGE=nl:de>. You have to first
enable localization, by setting LANG (or LC_ALL) to a value other than
"C", before you can use a language priority list through the LANGUAGE
variable. See also the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#The-LANGUAGE-variable>

For Esperanto there is a special language file in x-method format. X-method can
be used on systems that don't support Latin-3 or Unicode character encoding.
Make LANGUAGE equal to "eo-x:eo".

If you select a language which is not available you will get the
standard English messages.

=item B<DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR>

With the environment variable DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR the LOCALEDIR set during
compilation can be overruled. LOCALEDIR is used to find the language files. The
GNU default value is C</usr/local/share/locale>. Option "-V" will display the
LOCALEDIR that is used.

Example (windows cmd):

    set DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR=c:/my_prefix/share/locale
