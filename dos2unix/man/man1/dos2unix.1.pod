=head1 NAME

dos2unix - DOS/MAC to UNIX and vice versa text file format converter


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dos2unix [options] [-c CONVMODE] [-o FILE ...] [-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dos2unix converts plain text files in DOS/MAC format to UNIX format.
Binary files and non-regular files, such as soft links,
are automatically skipped, unless conversion is forced.

Dos2unix has a few conversion modes similar to dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris.

In DOS/Windows text files line endings exist out of a combination of two characters:
a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF).
In Unix text files line endings exists out of a single Newline character which
is equal to a DOS Line Feed (LF) character.
In Mac text files, prior to Mac OS X, line endings exist out of a single Carriage
Return character. Mac OS X is Unix based and has the same line endings as Unix.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c, --convmode CONVMODE>

Set conversion mode. Where CONVMODE is one of:
B<ascii>, B<7bit>, B<iso>, B<mac>
with ascii being the default.

=item B<-f, --force>

Force conversion of all files. Also binary files.

Add additional newline.
Only DOS line endings are changed to two Unix line endings.
In Mac mode only Mac line endings are changed to two Unix
line endings.

=item B<-n, --newfile INFILE OUTFILE ...>

New file mode. Convert the infile and write output to outfile. File names
must be given in pairs and wildcard names should NOT be used or you WILL
lose your files.

=item B<-o, --oldfile FILE ...>

Old file mode. Convert the file and write output to it. The program
default to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.

=head1 CONVERSION MODES

Conversion modes C<ascii>, C<7bit>, and C<iso>
are similar to those of dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris.

=over 4

=item B<ascii>

In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings.
Unix and Mac line endings are not changed.

Although the name of this mode is ASCII, which is a 7 bit standard,
the actual mode is 8 bit.

=item B<mac>

In this mode Mac line endings are converted to Unix line endings.
DOS and Unix line endigs are not changed.

=item B<7bit>

In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings.
All 8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to 255) are converted
to a space.

=item B<iso>

In this mode DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings.  Characters
are converted from DOS character set (code page) CP437 to ISO character set
ISO-8859-1. CP437 characters without ISO-8859-1 equivalent, for which
conversion is not possible, are converted to a dot.  CP437 is mainly used in
the USA. In Western Europe CP850 is more standard.

Another option to convert text files between different encodings is to use
dos2unix in combination with iconv(1). Iconv can convert between a long list of
character encodings. Some examples:

Convert from DOS DOSLatinUS to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP437 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from DOS DOSLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP850 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

    iconv -f CP1252 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows UTF-16 (Unicode) to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

=head1 UNICODE

Unicode files can be encoded in different encodings. On Unix/Linux Unicode
files are mostly encoded in UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is ASCII compatible. UTF-8
files can be in DOS, Unix or Mac format. It is safe to run dos2unix/unix2dos on
UTF-8 encoded files. On Windows mostly UTF-16 encoding is used for Unicode
files. Dos2unix/unix2dos should not be run on UTF-16 files. UTF-16 files are
automatically skipped, because it are binary files.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Get input from stdin and write output to stdout.

    dos2unix
    dos2unix -l -c mac

Convert and replace a.txt. Convert and replace b.txt.

    dos2unix a.txt b.txt
    dos2unix -o a.txt b.txt

Convert and replace a.txt in ascii conversion mode. 

    dos2unix a.txt

Convert and replace a.txt in ascii conversion mode.
Convert and replace b.txt in 7bit conversion mode.

    dos2unix a.txt -c 7bit b.txt
    dos2unix -c ascii a.txt -c 7bit b.txt

Convert a.txt from Mac to Unix format.

    dos2unix -c mac a.txt
    mac2unix a.txt

Convert and replace a.txt while keeping original date stamp.

    dos2unix -k a.txt
    dos2unix -k -o a.txt

    dos2unix -n a.txt e.txt

Convert a.txt and write to e.txt, keep date stamp of e.txt same as a.txt.

    dos2unix -k -n a.txt e.txt

    dos2unix -n c.txt e.txt -o a.txt b.txt -n d.txt f.txt

=head1 LOCALIZATION


=over 4

=item B<LANG>

The primary language is selected with the environment variable LANG. The LANG
variable consists out of several parts.  The first part is in small letters the
language code. The second is optional and is the country code in capital
letters, preceded with an underscore. There is also an optional third part:
character encoding, preceded with a dot. A few examples for POSIX standard type
shells:

    export LANG=nl               Dutch
    export LANG=nl_NL            Dutch, The Netherlands
    export LANG=nl_BE            Dutch, Belgium
    export LANG=es_ES            Spanish, Spain
    export LANG=es_MX            Spanish, Mexico
    export LANG=en_US.iso88591   English, USA, Latin-1 encoding
    export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8      English, UK, UTF-8 encoding

For a complete list of language and country codes see the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes>

On Unix systems you can use to command locale(1) to get locale specific
information.

=item B<LANGUAGE>

With the LANGUAGE environment variable you can specify a priority list of
languages, separated by colons. Wcd gives preference to LANGUAGE over LANG.
For instance, first Dutch and then German: LANGUAGE=nl:de. You have to first
enable localization, by setting LANG (or LC_ALL) to a value other than
"C", before you can use a language priority list through the LANGUAGE
variable. See also the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#The-LANGUAGE-variable>

For Esperanto there is a special language file in x-method format. X-method can
be used on systems that don't support Latin-3 or Unicode character encoding.
Make LANGUAGE equal to "eo-x:eo".

If you select a language which is not available you will get the
standard English messages.

=item B<DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR>

With the environment variable DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR the LOCALEDIR set during
compilation can be overruled. LOCALEDIR is used to find the language files. The
GNU default value is /usr/local/share/locale. Option "-V" will display the
LOCALEDIR that is used.

Example (windows cmd):

    set DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR=c:/my_prefix/share/locale
