BASIC INSTALLATION

    To build the program type:

        make


    To install:

        make install


    Clean:

        make clean


    Maintainer clean (for developers):

        make maintainer-clean


INSTALLATION NAMES

    By default the 'install' target will install the program in
    /usr/bin, the language files in /usr/share/locale
    and the man page in /usr/share/man. You can specify an
    installation prefix other than /usr by modifying the
    'prefix' variable. An Example:

        make prefix=$HOME clean all
        make prefix=$HOME install

NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT

    Native Language Support (NLS) is by default enabled.
    To disable NLS add ENABLE_NLS=. Example:

        make clean install ENABLE_NLS=
